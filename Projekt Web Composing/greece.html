		Currently, two pyramid-shaped structures have survived. One of them in Hellenikon, the other in Ligourio / Ligurio, a village near the ancient Epidaurus theater.</br>
		Although these structures are of great interest, written references are rather rare and are not mentioned in ancient sources. At least 2 pyramids in Greece no longer exist.
		Pausanias (2nd century AD) mentions two pyramid-like buildings, one, twelve miles southwest of the still standing construction at Hellinikon, a common tomb for soldiers who died in the legendary battle for the throne of Argos and another about whom he was told was the grave of Argives killed in the battle around 669/8 BC.
		None of them survived.<br>
		<br>
		On the way from Argos to Epidauria there is on the right a building made very like a pyramid, and on it in relief are wrought shields of the Argive shape.
		Here took place a fight for the throne between Proetus and Acrisius; the contest, they say, ended in a draw, and a reconciliation resulted afterwards, as neither could gain a decisive victory.
		The story is that they and their hosts were armed with shields, which were first used in this battle.
		For those that fell on either side was built here a common tomb, as they were fellow citizens and kinsmen. <br>

		There is considerable controversy about the dates of these structures, with conflict between dating based on archeological excavations and dating through what was at the time the new technique of thermoluminescence dating, Ioannis Liritzis and his team argue for an early date through five sub-projects: <br>
		<br>
		1) geophysical prospection inside and around the two pyramidals at Hellenikon and Ligourio, where buried monuments were discovered, <br>
		<br>
		2) these results directed the archaeological excavations carried out by archaeologist A.Sampson and archaeologists of the Archaeological Museum of Nauplion. Amongst the new finds were foundations of rooms, ceramics of Classical, Hellenistic, Roman and Protochristian periods, and protohelladic II in the exterior foundations of Hellenikon above the bedrock. A comparative study of masonries was also made, <br>
		<br>
		3) astronomical orientation of the long entrance corridor was found related to the rise of Orion’s belt occurring in c. 2000-2400 BC, <br>
		<br>
		4) the dating of some parts of the overlying large megalithic blocks in the wall, with the novel thermoluminescence dating method of rock surfaces. Sampling was chosen for their firmness and lack of sun exposure of internal contact surfaces, by removing a few milligrams of powder from pieces in firm contact. Seven pieces gave an age range of c. 2000–2500 BC, while two ceramic sherds of non-diagnostic typology one from Hellenikon and one from Ligourio dated by TL and OSL gave concordant ages of 3000±250 BC and 660±200 BC respectively. This time frame would place construction of these structures at a time overlapping the construction of the pyramids in Egypt.<br>
