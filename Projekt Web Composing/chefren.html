	<p class="info">
			It is the second-tallest and the second-largest pyramid of the Ancient Egyptian Pyramids of Giza
			Chefren's pyramid was erected around 2540 BC. Chefren - the fourth ruler from the fourth Egyptian dynasty, raised not only the pyramid, which was to be his tomb, but also the sphinx.
			Originally, Chefren's pyramid was 143 m high. Today it is 7 m lower. Chefren's pyramid has a funerary complex that is very well preserved to this day.

			However, the Sphinx Temple belongs to it, was found only in 1853. The inner walls of the temple are made of red granite, and also of limestone.  
			You can enter the pyramid from the north. There are two entrances. One of them is located 11 m above the ground.
			The second one is available freely for tourists, because it is at the height of the pyramid surrounding the ground.
			Following the underground corridors, we reach the grave chamber. Its part at the bottom was carved into the rock. There is a granite sarcophagus connected to the floor.
