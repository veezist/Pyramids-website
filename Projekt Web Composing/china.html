	<p class="info">
	In 2000, China recognized that there were 400 pyramids in the Shanxi region, to the north of Xi’an.  Where some of these structures do in fact serve as tombs, others suggest the earliest Chinese pyramids served a more mysterious purpose. Hausdorf even asserts that these structures have an extra-terrestrial origin. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="questions">Just how old are they?</p>
	 While many pyramids can be dated to various dynasties, others are believed to be older. Analyzing an aerial photograph of one set of pyramids east of Xi’an, ancient civilization researcher and author, Graham Hancock, determined that their layout coincided with the constellation of Gemini. However, computer analysis found that it is what Gemini would have looked like on the spring equinox in 10,500 BC.

	<p class="questions">The Great Pyramid of China</p>
	<br>
	<p class="info">
	The story behind the Great Pyramid of China is beyond fascinating.
	For years, the government has not allowed proper studies to be performed on the numerous pyramids near the city of Xi’an.
	Excursions that managed to sneak into the area where the pyramids are discovered numerous anomalies like a metallic material which could not be identified by researchers.
	The Pyramids are believed to be over 8,000 years old.

	<p class="questions">
	Are the Pyramid of China among the largest on the planet?
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="info">
	 According to many, one of the Pyramids –kept a secret for years —in China is so large that the Great Pyramid of Giza seems like a miniature monument.<br>

	 The story of the Chinese pyramid began at the end of the Second World War when American pilot James Gaussman was about to complete a resupply mission to the forces of the Chinese Army. Suddenly, a fault in the aircraft engine forced him to return to the Assam base located in northern India, for safety reasons, he decided to fly at a lower altitude. Shortly after flying over the city of Xi’an, heading southwest, the pilot encountered what looked like a gigantic pyramid. Surprised, after making several passes over the humongous structure, he decided to take a number of photographs, which later included a detailed report which were handed to his superiors as soon as he returned to base.<br>
	 <br>
	  Even more fascinating is the fact that the Great Pyramid of Egypt has around 52,900 square meters, the ‘Great Pyramid of China’ exceeds the number with a staggering 202,000 square meters.
	  Over the years, numerous pilots claimed to have observed gigantic Pyramids in China, and there is a great amount of images, taken by pilots and satellites which support the existence ef the mysterious structures in Asia.
	   However, inexplicably, the Chinese authorities have rejected the existence of such monuments.<br>
	   <br>
		In the early twentieth century, explorers and traders, like German citizens Frederick Schroeder and Oscar Maman, have testified to the presence of not only one, but several pyramids located around the Chinese city of Xi’an.
		 But the mystery behind the Pyramid of China is even more fascinating. According to reports, numerous European excursions managed to take samples of objects and metals around the Pyramids of China. Analysis showed that these structures could be well over 8,000 years old, but the most fascinating detail isn’t the age of the Pyramids: Interestingly, the metallic material present at the Pyramids has not been identified so far; since it is made out of materials that are unknown to modern science.
