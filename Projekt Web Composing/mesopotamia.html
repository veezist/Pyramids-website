	<h1>Mesopotamia</h1>

	<p class="info">
	Mesopotamia, which is located between the two rivers: Euphrates and Tigris, around 2000 BC began to
create pyramidal structures called ziggurats. However, there were not many of them because
they were built of bricks dried by the sun. Colors, on which ziggurats were painted, are golden
/ brown. It was believed that these buildings were flats for the gods, and therefore they were
not the place of public services and ceremonies. Every city in Mesopotamia had its own God
patron, who could be close to humanity through the ziggurat. Only priests could enter the
center of the ziggurat and their duties included taking care of the needs of the gods. The
result was that the priests were very powerful members of the Sumerian society. There are
32 known ziggurats in mesopotamias. Most of them are in Iraq and 4 are in Iran.
