	<h2>Noah Built The Great Pyramid</h2>

	<p class="info">
In 1859, a British publisher named John Taylor published his own book, The Great Pyramid: Why It Was Built and Who Built It. Taylor had never seen the Pyramid of Giza, but, after studying its measurements—which had been compiled by Oxford astronomer John Greaves and the French engineers who had accompanied Napoleon during his expedition in Egypt—he concluded that the massive structure was a repository for the "divine system" of all mathematical truths.

Taylor's elaborate calculations included the observation that, if you divide the pyramid's height into twice the side of its base, you end up with a close approximation of pi. And, he argued that the structure was built using a unit of measurement he called the "Pyramid inch," which was one twenty-fifth of the "sacred cubit" and nearly identical to the British inch. Taylor cited this as proof that the modern system of measurement was divinely inspired.

			Taylor believed that Noah, not the Egyptians, was the true architect: "He who built the Ark was, of all men, the most competent to direct the building of the Great Pyramid."

		Aliens built pyramids - Speed of light
</p>
<br>
<p class="info">
		Acient pyramids of Giza could have been built by advanced alien visitors, according to shock
		new claims from a researcher. Conspiracy theorists have claimed for decades that
		construction of the ancient wonders were far beyond the means of the early Egyptians - so
		they must have had outside help.
		
</p>
<br>
<p class="info">
		Researchers believe extraterrestrials left vital clues in the design of the pyramids which
		prove it could not have been our ancestors who built the extraordinary feats of engineering.
		And the experts claim the truth lies behind one thing - the co-ordinates.
		
</p>
<br>
<p class="info">
		The speed of light is 299,792,458 metres per second and the geographic co-ordinates for the Great Pyramid are 29.9792458°N

<p class="info">
		Supersonic Levitation was used to build the pyramids- According to ancient wisdom, the power of sound is almost supernaturally immense, and can be used to levitate and move large objects, if done in the correct technique.

		In her book Acoustic Levitation of Stones: Monastery Construction, Tibetan Style, Author Bruce Cathie claims having witnessed Tibetan monks moving huge boulders with their
		voices and musical instruments. The precise location of musicians and singers was crucial for the “anti-gravity sonic effects” to work. Swedish engineer Olaf Alexanderson claims that “the knowledge of the various vibrations in the audio range demonstrates to a scientist of physics that a vibrating and condensed sound field can nullify the power of gravitation.” This had led many to believe that this must have been the way that the huge rocks used to build the pyramids were transported and placed on top of each other. As opposed to good old-fashioned slavery.
